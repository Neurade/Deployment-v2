# Coding Convention

## Style
- Use 4 spaces for indentation.
- Always end statements with semicolons (in JS).
- Keep line length under 100 characters.
- Use single quotes for strings in JavaScript.

## Naming
- Use camelCase for variable and function names.
- Use PascalCase for class names.
- Avoid abbreviations unless well-known (e.g., `id`, `url`).
- Prefix boolean variables with `is`, `has`, or `can`.

## Structure
- One module per file.
- Keep function length under 40 lines.
- Use early return to reduce nesting.
- Group related functions together.

## Comments
- Use docstrings for all functions longer than 5 lines.
- Write comments in English.
- Avoid redundant comments (do not state the obvious).

## Best Practices
- Avoid magic numbers. Define constants at the top.
- Do not repeat yourself (DRY principle).
- Validate input and handle errors gracefully.
